\section{Conclusions and future work}
We presented a probabilistic reachability analysis tool. The tool combines $\delta$-decision 
procedures \cite{gao2013dreal, gao2013satisfiability, gaodelta} and statistical testing techniques. 
It supports bounded reachability analysis and parameter estimation for hybrid systems with parametric 
uncertainty. This tool was used for the reachability analysis of two representative examples - a prostate 
cancer treatment control and the cardiac system - which are currently out of the reach of other formal
(SMT-based) tools. In the near future, we plan to extend support for more general stochastic hybrid models 
that include probabilistic jumps with discrete or continuous distributions. Also, we plan to develop
a parallel version of our tool.
