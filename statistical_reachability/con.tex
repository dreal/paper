\section{Conclusion and future work}
In conclusion, we presented a reachability analysis tool. The tool combines $\delta$-decision procedure \cite{gao2013dreal, gao2012dreal, gaodelta} and statistical testing techniques. It supports bounded reachability analysis and parameter estimation for hybrid systems with parametric uncertainty. This tool was used for the reachability analysis of two representative examples - the prostate cancer treatment control and the cardiac system, and of additional 19 benchmarks. In the near future, we plan to support the reachability analysis for more general stochastic hybrid models, where, besides probabilistic system parameters, there also exist probabilistic jumps with discrete or continuous distributions.
