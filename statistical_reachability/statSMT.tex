\begin{abstract}
We describe the probabilistic bounded reachability problem of hybrid systems, i.e. checking whether a hybrid system satisfies a certain reachability property within bounded steps with a probability greater (or less) than a fixed threshold. Especially, we present a novel Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and statistical tests based approach. Standard approaches to the bounded reachability problem of hybrid systems require numerical solutions for huge optimization problems and become infeasible with larger state spaces. Generalization to probabilistic hybrid systems are even more challenging. Our approach solves the reachability problem by combining randomized sampling of probabilistic system parameters, SMT-based bounded reachability analysis of hybrid systems, and statistical tests. Unlike the Statistical Model Checking (SMC) approach, which adopts simulation-based analysis for the nonlinear parts of systems, our method uses a $\delta$-complete decision procedure. This guarantees soundness and relative completeness. We demonstrate that our method is feasible for general hybrid systems with probabilistic systems parameters via applying to a representative example: a hybrid model of the prostate cancer with probabilistic parameters representing personalized information. (We also show that our method can be used to handle parameter estimation problem for the probabilistic hybrid systems. ?)

\section{Introduction}
- Start with the motivations (application areas needing both nonlinear arithmetic and probabilistic system parameters. (Hybrid systems))\\
- Introduce dReal and dReach as the SMT solver and the checker for Hybrid models. (focus on the strength of dReal - sound and relatively complete for nonlinear)\\
- Introduce the statistical model checking, especially different statistical analyzing methods to estimate the probability of a model satisfying a property.

\subsection{Related work}
(TODO: Need to reword and reorganize in a more concise way)

- Statistical Model Checking (point: Simulation-based analysis vs. decision procedure- based analysis. Correctness? $\delta$-decidable?)
- Stochastic SMT, and its related work (it can handle more general stochastic hybrid systems â€“ probabilistic hybrid automata, but cannot handle nonlinear arithmetic over Reals)

1. Stochastic SMT (probabilistic hybrid automata)

2. Paolo's Statistical Model Checker (the whole statMC techniques for model checking stochastic hybrid systems) (general stochastic hybrid systems): the statistical model checking procedure, however, does not belong to the class of exhaustive state-space exploration methods but is based on system simulation and on Bayesian statistics. As a consequence, the results obtained from statistical model checking are not guaranteed to be correct. Nevertheless, two reasons are presented to motivate this simulation-based approach: first, results are usually obtained much faster compared to exhaustive search and, second, the probability of returning a wrong result can be mad e arbitrarily small. [ZPC10] [Aba07] 

3. Zhang et al. presented an approach to verification of safety properties concerning the probability of reaching unsafe states in probabilistic hybrid automat a [ZSR + 10]. More recently, the expressiveness of the above system model was enhanced considerably in [FHH + 11], namely by permitting continuous probability distributions in discrete state changes. The resulting system class is called stochastic hybrid automata. (stochastic hybrid automata)

4. The recent work described in [HNP + 11] targets at the same problem as in [ZSR + 10], namely the probabilistic reachability analysis of probabilistic hybrid automata, with the suggested analysis approach also relying on finite-state abstract ion of the given infinite- state system. (probabilistic hybrid automata)

5. In control theory, a model similar to probabilistic hybrid automaton is currently in the focus that is called discrete-time stochastic hybrid system (DTSHS) [AAP + 06b, AAP + 06a, Aba07, APLS08]. (DTSHS)

6. Another approach to a very similar problem as above was suggested in [AKLP10, AKLP11], where the DTSHS model is autonomous, i.e. without non-deterministic control inputs. Akin to the method above, the probability of remaining in the safe region is also described as a dynamic programming scheme, and the continuous state space is again discretized by a finite-state grid. (DTSHS)

7. The authors of [AKM11] proposed an approach to model checking autonomous DTSHSs against linear time objectives like, for instance, liveness instead of mere safety properties. (DTSHS)

8. More recently, Platzer suggested a logic-based approach to safety analysis of stochastic hybrid systems [Pla11]. As a formal model, stochastic hybrid programs (SHPs) were introduced. This system class is very expressive on the stochastic side a s it comprises stochastic differential equations, discrete probabilistic branching, and random assignments to real- valued variables, while it seems that non-deterministic branching and parallel composition are not expressible. For the specification of system properties, a logic called stochastic differential dynamic logic is considered. A proof calculus is then proposed to verify logical properties of SHPs.  (SHPs)

9. In [WZH07], model checking probabilistic programs against specifications of a fragment of PCTL is examined. Probabilistic programs are very similar to discrete-time probabilistic hybrid automata as they support non-deterministic and discrete probabilistic choices as well as arithmetic expressions over unbounded integers and reals to describe the program execution. (probabilistic programs)

10. Aiming at probabilistic (unsafe) state reachability, the verification technique of [WZH07] was enhanced in [HWZ08] as follows: the authors suggested a method to refine the predicate abstraction based on counterexamples and furthermore ex tended the approach to falsification. (probabilistic programs)

11. The work presented in [FHW10] discusses probabilistic reachability analysis of a rich probabilistic model that is called first-order probabilistic timed automaton (FPTA). 

12. The work on probabilistic safety analysis of discrete -time Markov chains (DTMCs) published in [WBB09]. The considered system model is much more restrictive than probabilistic hybrid automata: the state space is finite and the behavior is fully probabilistic, i.e. without non-determinism. 

\subsection{Structure of the paper}


The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we give formal background including the $\delta$-complete decision procedure (dReal), formal definitions of hybrid automata, and the probabilistic bounded reachability problems, and the encoding from reachability problems into SMT problems. Then, in Section 3 we introduce our statSMT in details. We then demonstrate the feasibility of our method via applying to the prostate cancer model, and give some experimental results (Section 4). We conclude in Section 5.

\section{statSMT}

To solve the probabilistic bounded reachability problem, {\bf statSMT} first samples the defined random variables according to the given distributions. Then, for each sample, we obtain a model of the hybrid system without any probabilistic parameters. We call this as a sampled model. {\bf statSMT} then calls {\bf dReach}, which is a bounded reachability analyzer based on {\bf dReal}, and returns either unsat or $\delta$ sat for each sampled model. With a sufficient number of sampled models, using distinct hypothesis testing and estimation methods, {\bf statSMT} terminates the entire procedure, and decides whether the system satisfies the given reachability property with a probability larger (or smaller) than the specified threshold.

\subsection{Input format}
The inputs to our {\bf statSMT} tool are descriptions of hybrid automata with random variables (representing the probabilistic system parameters), and the reachability property to be checked. Following roughly the same format as the above definition of hybrid automata, and adding the declarations of random variables, the description of a automaton is of the following structure.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Preprocessor.} We can use the C language syntax to define constants and macros. When defining, random variables, which will be declared later, can also be used. For example, we can write,\\

$\#define\;\; x \;\;2.0$\\
$\#define\;\; y\;\; (z^2 \;+\; 1)$\\

where $z$ can be a random variable.\\

\item {\bf Variable declaration.} For a random variable, the declaration specifies its distribution and name, with the format - $Dist \; \; var_nam;$, where currently "$Dist$" can be "$B(p)$" (Bernoulli distribution), "$U(p, \;q)$" (Uniform distribution), "$N(p, \;q)$" (Gaussian distribution), and "$E(p)$" (Exponential distribution). $p$ and $q$ are parameters for these distributions. (Note: it is easy to include additional distributions if needed.)\\
For the variables which are not random variables, they are required to be declared within bounds. For instance,\\
$[-10, \; 20.1]\; \;  x;$\\

\item {\bf Hybrid automaton.} A hybrid automaton is represented by a set of modes. Each mode is of the following structure.\\

$
\{\;\; mode \;\; <int>;\\
invt: \;\; <mode\_invariant\; block>\\
flow: \;\; <ODE\; block>\\
jump: \;\; <jump\;block>\\
\}
$\\

In the mode\_ invariant block, we can give any logic formula for the variables. For the ODE block, each differential equation is of the format: "$d/dt \; [<var>]\;\;=\;\;<fun>;$". As for the jump block, each jump condition is written as "$<logic\_formula1> \;\; ==> \;\; @<int>\;\;<logic\_formula2>;$", where the first logic formula is given as the guard of the jump, and the later one specifies the reset condition after the jump.\\

\item {\bf Initial conditions and goal.}

\subsection{Command line}
After building, {\bf statSMT} can be simply used through:\\

{\bf   
$statsmt\_sq\;\; <testfile> \;\;<pdrh-modelfile> \;\;<dReach>\;\;<k> $
}\\

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $<testfile>$ is a text file containing a sequence of test specifications. We will cover different statistical tests in the next sub-section;
\item $<pdrh-modelfile>$ is a .pdrh file describing the model of a hybrid system with probabilistic system parameters. It is of the input format described in last sub-section;
\item $<dReach>$ is a bounded reachability analyzing tool for hybrid systems based on dReal; and
\item $<k>$ is the number of steps of the model that the tool will explore.\\
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Statistical test options}
Currently, {\bf statSMT} supports the following hypothesis testing methods and estimation methods.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Hypothesis testing methods:}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Lai's test [ai88]. As a simple class of sequential tests, it tests the one-sided composite hypotheses $H_0: \; \theta \leq \theta_0$ versus $H_1:\; \theta \geq \theta_1$ for the natural parameter $\theta$ of an exponential family of distributions under the $0-1$ loss and cost $c$ per observation. [Nearly Optimal Sequential Tests of Composite Hypotheses] shows that these tests have nearly optimal frequentist properties and also provide approximate Bayes solutions with respect to a large class of priors. Using this method, the user needs to specify a test option with the test file with this format: $Lai\;\; <theta>\;\; <cost per sample>$.\\
\item Bayes factor test [RA95]. The use of Bayes factors is a Bayesian alternative to classical hypothesis testing. It is based on the Bayes' theorem. Hypothesis testing with Bayes factors is more robust than frequentist hypothesis testing, as the Bayesian form avoids model selection bias, evaluates evidence in favor the null hypothesis, includes model uncertainty, and allows non-nested models to be compared. Also, frequentist significance tests become biased in favor of rejecting the null hypothesis with sufficiently large sample size. $BFT\;\; <theta>\;\; <threshold T> \;\;<alpha> \;\;<beta>$ is the right format to specify Bayes factor test in {\bf statSMT}, where $\theta$ is a probability threshold satisfying $0 < \theta < 1$, $T$ is a ratio threshold satisfying $T > 1$, and $alpha$, and $beta$ are beta prior parameters.\\
\item Bayes factor test with indifference region [citation for the "indifference region"?]. The indifference region indicates the distance between two hypotheses, which is set to separate two hypotheses. (Needs to know more about the indifference region.) To use this option, we can simply type in this format: \\
$BFTI \;\;<theta> \;\;<threshold T>\;\; <alpha> \;\;<beta> \;\;<indifference\; region\; delta>$.\\
\item Sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) [WA45]. As for he SPRT, we consider a simple hypothesis $H_0:\;\theta = \theta_0$ against a simple alternative $H_1:\;\theta = \theta_1$. With the critical region $\Lambda_n$ and two thresholds $A$, and $B$, SPRT decides that $H_0$ is true and stops when $\Lambda_n < A$. It decides that $H_1$ is true and terminates if $\Lambda_n > B$. If $A\; < \Lambda_n < B$, it will collect another observation to obtain a new critical region $\Lambda_{n+1}$. The SPRT is optimal, among all sequential tests, in the sense that it minimizes the average sample size. To use this method in {\bf statSMT}, specify a test option in this form:\\ $SPRT\;\; <theta> \;\;<threshold T>\;\; <indifference\; region\; delta>$\\
\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Estimation methods:}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Chernoff-Hoeffding bound []. (know nothing about this bound... @Sean, maybe we can ask Paolo to write a paragraph for it?)
\item Bayesian Interval Estimation with Beta prior [ZPC10]. In this approach, we are interested in estimating $p$, the unknown probability that a random sampled model satisfies a specified reachability property. The estimate will be in the form of a confidence interval, congaing $p$ with an arbitrary high probability. [ZPC10] assumes that the unknown $p$ is given by a random variable, whose density is called the prior density, and focuses on Beta priors. The authors has showed that, with this Bayesian interval estimation method, the probability of giving a wrong answer is arbitrarily small, and speed of obtaining an answer is higher than the sequential hypothesis testing. To adopt this method, the user can follow the following format:\\
$BEST\;\; <delta> \;\;<coverage probability>\;\; <alpha> \;\;<beta>$\\
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
