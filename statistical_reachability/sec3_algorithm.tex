\section{SReach algorithm}
First, {\it SReach} uses a set of random variables to encode all the stochastic information. In detail, when a hybrid automaton with parametric uncertainty is given, {\it SReach} directly declares each probabilistic system parameter as a random variable with a known distribution. While for a PHA, each probabilistic guarded command $g \rightarrow p_1:u_1 + \cdots + p_m:u_m$ is rewritten by introducing a new random variable $rv$ such that $Pr(rv = i) = p_i$. For example, a probabilistic command $x \geq 1 \to 0.7 : (x' = 1)+ 0.3 :( x' = x)$ will be rewritten as two new guarded commands after introducing a new random variable $r$ whose distribution is $(Pr(r=1)=0.7, Pr(r=2)=0.3)$. The first command is $x \geq 1 \wedge r = 1 \to x'=1$. The second is $x \geq 1 \wedge r = 2 \to x'=x$. When additional randomness is involved in assigning probabilities for probabilistic transitions or in resetting system variables, extra random variables are needed. For instance, {\it SReach} can express a probabilistic guarded command as $x \geq 1 \to p_1 : (x' = p_2 )+ (1-p_1) :( x' = x)$, where $p_1$ is a random variable which obeys a Uniform distribution $U(0.6,0.85)$, and $p_2$ is a random variable whose distribution is $N(0,1)$, \ie, normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

After encoding all the stochastic elements using random variables, {\it SReach} randomly samples all the random variables according to their probability distributions. For each sampled assignment to these random variables, we obtain a corresponding intermediate hybrid automaton by replacing all the random variables with their assigned values. Then, the $\delta$-complete analyzer {\it dReach} \cite{gaodelta} is utilized to analyze each intermediate hybrid automaton $M_i$, together with the desired precision $\delta$ and unfolding depth $k$. The analyzer returns either unsat or $\delta$-sat for $M_i$ (see Appendix \ref{apndx:dreach} for more details on $\delta$-complete decision procedures). This information is then used by statistical tests to decide whether to stop or to repeat the procedure, and to return the estimated probability. The full procedure is illustrated in Algorithm \ref{fig:sreach}, where $MP$ is a given probabilistic model, and $ST$ indicates which statistical testing method will be used. $Succ$ is used to record the number of $\delta$-sat instances that are returned by {\it dReach}, and $N$ denotes the total number of samples generated so far. These two numbers are then the inputs of {\it SReach}'s statistical testing procedure $ST$. The procedure $ExtractRV$ is used to obtain the full set of involved random variables, $Sim$ is to sample them according to their probability distributions, and $Gen$ is to generate an intermediate hybrid automaton considering the original probabilistic model and a sampled assignment to random variables. Since the full nondeterminism within the intermediate hybrid automata has been considered when handling the bounded reachability problems, the estimated probabilities computed by {\it SReach} are the maximum probabilities. Also, for a probabilistic hybrid automaton, sampling and fixing all the probabilistic transitions in advance results in an over-approximation of the original probabilistic model. Because the result is an over-approximation, safety properties are preserved. To improve the performance of {\it SReach}, each sampled assignment, together with its corresponding {\it dReach} result, has been recorded for avoiding repeated calls to {\it dReach} with the same sampled assignments. This significantly reduces the total calls to {\it dReach} for PHAs (with additional randomness for transition probabilities), as the size of the sample space involving random variables describing probabilistic jumps is comparatively small. For the example PHA, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:examplepha}, with this improvement, the total checking time for a reachability problem has been decreased from $11291.31$s for $658$ samples ($17.16$s per sample) to $3295.82$s ($5.01$s per sample). To further improve the performance, a parallel version of {\it SReach} has been implemented using OpenMP, where multiple samples and corresponding hybrid automata are generated, and passed to {\it dReach} simultaneously. Using this parallel {\it SReach} on a 4-core machine, the running time for the example PHA has been further decreased to $2119.55s$ for $660$ samples ($3.33$s per sample).

Currently, {\it SReach} supports a number of hypothesis testing and statistical estimation techniques including: {Lai's test} \cite{lai1988nearly}, {Bayes factor test} \cite{kass1995bayes}, {Bayes factor test with indifference region} \cite{younes2005verification}, {Sequential probability ratio test (SPRT)}\cite{wald1945sequential}, {Chernoff-Hoeffding bound} \cite{hoeffding1963probability}, {Bayesian Interval Estimation with Beta prior}\cite{zuliani2010bayesian}, and {Direct Sampling}. All methods produce answers which are correct up to a precision that can be set arbitrarily by the user. See Appendix \ref{apndx:stat} for more details about how these tests can guarantee an arbitrary small error bound between the estimated probability and the real one. With these hypothesis testing methods, {\it SReach} can answer qualitative questions, such as ``Does the model satisfy a given reachability property in $k$ steps with probability greater than a certain threshold?'' With the above statistical estimation techniques, {\it SReach} can offer answers to quantitative problems. For instance, ``What is the probability that the model satisfies a given reachability property in $k$ steps?''  {\it SReach} can also handle additional types of interesting problems by encoding them as bounded reachability problems. The {\bf model validation} problem with prior knowledge can be encoded as a bounded reachability question. After expressing prior knowledge about the given model as reachability properties, is there any number of steps $k$ in which the model satisfies a given property? If none exists, the model is incorrect regarding the given prior knowledge. If, for each property, a witness is returned, we can conclude that the model is correct with regard to the prior knowledge. The {\bf parameter estimation} problem can also be encoded as a $k$-step reachability problem. Does there exist a parameter combination for which the model reaches the given goal region in $k$ steps? If so, this parameter combination is potentially a good estimation for the system parameters. The goal here is to find a combination with which all the given goal regions can be reached in a bounded number of steps. Moreover, {\bf sensitivity analysis} can be conducted by a set of bounded reachability queries as well: Are the results of reachability analysis the same for different possible values of a certain system parameter? If so, the model is insensitive to this parameter with regard to the given prior knowledge.
