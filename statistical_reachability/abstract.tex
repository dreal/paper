In this paper we present a novel tool, {\it SReach}, which solves probabilistic bounded reachability problems for two classes of stochastic hybrid systems. The first one is (nonlinear) hybrid automata with parametric uncertainty. The second one is probabilistic hybrid automata with additional randomness of both transition probabilities and variable resets. Standard approaches to reachability problems for linear hybrid systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems, and become infeasible for systems involving both nonlinear dynamics over the reals and stochasticity. Our approach encodes stochastic information by using a set of newly introduced random variables, and combines randomized sampling of these random variables, an SMT-based bounded reachability analysis, 
and statistical tests. {\it SReach} utilizes $\delta$-complete decision procedures 
to solve reachability problems in a sound way, i.e., it always decides correctly if, for a given
assignment to all random variables, the system actually reaches the unsafe region.
Compared to standard simulation-based methods, our approach supports 
non-deterministic branching, increases the coverage of simulation, and avoids the
zero-crossing problem. We demonstrate that our method is feasible for general
hybrid systems by applying {\it SReach} to
various nonlinear hybrid systems with parametric uncertainty, and for probabilistic hybrid automata with the help of our synthesized Killerred biological model.
