\section{Conclusions and future work}
We presented a probabilistic reachability analysis tool. The tool combines $\delta$-decision 
procedures \cite{gao2013dreal, gao2013satisfiability, gaodelta} and statistical testing techniques. 
It supports bounded reachability analysis for hybrid systems with parametric 
uncertainty and probabilistic hybrid automata with additional randomness. This tool was used for the reachability analysis of three representative examples - a prostate 
cancer treatment control, a cardiac model, and a synthesized Killerred model - which are currently out of the reach of other formal (SMT-based) tools. In the near future, we plan to extend support for more general stochastic hybrid models 
that include probabilistic jumps with continuous distributions, and stochastic differential equations.
