\section{Conclusions and future work}
We have presented a probabilistic bounded reachability analysis tool that combines $\delta$-decision 
procedures and statistical tests. It supports reachability analysis for hybrid systems with parametric 
uncertainty and probabilistic hybrid automata with additional randomness. It takes the full nondeterminism of models into account, and ensures the estimation accuracy by placing arbitrary small error bounds. This tool has been used for the probabilistic bounded reachability analysis of three representative examples - a prostate 
cancer treatment model, a cardiac model, and a synthesized Killerred model - which are currently out of the reach of other formal tools. In the near future, we plan to extend support for more general stochastic hybrid models 
that include probabilistic jumps with continuous distributions, and stochastic differential equations.
