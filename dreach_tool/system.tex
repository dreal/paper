\subsection{Hybrid Systems}

Let $H = \langle X, Q, \mathsf{flow}, \mathsf{jump},
\mathsf{inv},\mathsf{init}\rangle$ be a hybrid system, where
$\mathsf{flow}$, $\mathsf{jump}$, $\mathsf{inv}$, $\mathsf{init}$ are
SMT formulas that \texttt{dReal} can handle (first-order formulas over
the reals that allow polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential
functions, Lipschitz-continuous ODEs, etc.)

Now specify a numerical error bound $\delta$, and recall that for any
formula $\varphi$ we have defined a notion of $\delta$-perturbation of
$\varphi$, written as $\varphi^{\delta}$. We can then define the
$\delta$-perturbation of $H$ as:

\[
H^{\delta} = \langle X, Q, {\mathsf{flow}}^{\delta},
{\mathsf{jump}}^{\delta}, {\mathsf{inv}}^{\delta},
{\mathsf{init}}^{\delta}\rangle,
\]

by simply relaxing the logic formulas in the representation of $H$.
Choose $n\in\mathbb{N}$ to be a bound on the number of discrete mode
changes and $T\in \mathbb{R}^+$ an upper bound on the time duration.
Let $\mathsf{unsafe}$ encode a subset of $X\times Q$, the state space
of $H$. The bounded $\delta$-reachability problem asks for one of the
following answers:

\begin{itemize}
\item  safe: $H$ cannot reach $\mathsf{unsafe}$ in $n$ steps within
  time $T$.
\item $\delta$-unsafe: $H^{\delta}$ can reach ${\mathsf{unsafe}}^{\delta}$ in $n$ steps within time $T$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{drh: A Language for Hybrid Systems}

\subsubsection{Definition}

We define \texttt{drh}, a small language for describing hybrid systems
and specifying their initial and safety conditions. It consists of
five sections - macro definitions, variable declarations, mode
definitions, and initial condition, and goals.

\begin{align*}
  \textit{drh} := \ & \textit{macro-definition}^*\\
                  & \textit{variable-declaration}^+\\
                  & \textit{mode-definition}^+\\
                  & \textit{initial-condition}\\
                  & \textit{goal}^+
\end{align*}

In macro definitions, we allow users to define C-preprocessor macros
(\texttt{\#define}) which can be used in following sections. Macros
are expanded before the other parts are processed.

A variable declaration has a form:
\[
\textit{variable-declaration} \ := \ \texttt{[}
                                     \textit{l}
                                     \texttt{,}
                                     \ \textit{u}
                                     \texttt{]}
                                     \ \textit{var}
                                     \texttt{;}
\]
and it declares a real variable $var$ whose domain is $[l, u] \in
\mathbb{IR}$. A special variable \textit{time} has to be delcared to
specify the time bound of bounded model checking.

A mode definition consists of mode id, mode invariant, flow, and jump.
\begin{align*}
  \textit{mode-definition} \ := & \ \texttt{\{}
                                    \texttt{mode} \ \textit{id}\texttt{;}\\
                           & \ \ \  \texttt{invt}:(\textit{formula} \texttt{;})^+\\
                           & \ \ \  \texttt{flow}:\textit{ode}^+\\
                           & \ \ \ \texttt{jump}:\textit{jump}^+ \texttt{\}}
\end{align*}
\textit{id} is a unique unsigned integer assigned to a mode. An
invariant is a conjuction of logic formulae which must hold in a mode.
A flow describes a continuous dynamics of a mode by providing a set of
ordinary differential equations (\textit{ode}s) which is a form of
``\texttt{d/dt[}\textit{x}\texttt{]=}\textit{exp}''. \textit{jump} is
a form of ``\textit{guard} \texttt{==>} \texttt{@}\textit{n}
\textit{reset}'' where \textit{guard} is a logic formula specifying a
condition to make a transition, $n$ is an id of target mode, and
\textit{reset} is a logic formula specifying the relationship between
old and new values.

\texttt{initial-condition} is of a form
``\texttt{@}\textit{mode-id} \textit{formula}\texttt{;}''
where \textit{mode-id} is an initial mode of a hybrid system and
\textit{formula} specifies the initial configuration of it.

\texttt{goal} shares the same syntactic structure
``\texttt{@}\textit{mode-id} \textit{formula}\texttt{;}'' of
\textit{initial-condition} with a different interpretation. It poses a
reachability question: ``Is there a trajectory of a hybrid system
reaching \textit{mode-id} while satisfying the goal condition \textit{formula}?''.
