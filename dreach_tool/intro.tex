\dReach{} is a bounded model checker for hybrid systems. It encodes bounded reachability problems of hybrid systems as first-order formulas over the real numbers, and solves them using $\delta$-decision procedures in the SMT solver \dReal{}. \dReach{} is able to handle a wide range of highly nonlinear hybrid systems. It has scaled well on various realistic nonlinear models from biomedical and robotics applications~\cite{}.

It is well-known that the standard bounded reachability problems for simple hybrid systems are already highly undecidable~\cite{DBLP:conf/rex/AlurD91,DBLP:conf/hybrid/AlurCHH92}. In previous work~\cite{}, we have defined the notion of $\delta$-reachability problem of hybrid systems. In this new framework, we have shown that bounded $\delta$-reachability is decidable for a wide range of hybrid systems, with reasonable complexity bounds~\cite{}. We give a brief review of the framework in Section~\ref{}.
