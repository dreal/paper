\begin{abstract}
  \dReach{} is a bounded reachability analysis tool for nonlinear
  hybrid systems. It encodes reachability problems of hybrid systems
  to first-order formulas over real numbers, which are solved by
  delta-decision procedures in the SMT solver \dReal{}. In this way,
  \dReach{} is able to handle a wide range of highly nonlinear hybrid
  systems. It has scaled well on various realistic models
  from biomedical and robotics applications.

% Tool demonstration papers focus on the usage aspects of tools. As with
% regular tool papers, authors are strongly encouraged to make their
% tools publicly available, preferably on the web. Theoretical
% foundations and experimental evaluation are not required, however, a
% motivation as to why the tool is interesting and significant should be
% provided. Tool demonstration papers can have a maximum of 6 pages.
% They should have an appendix of up to 6 additional pages with details
% on the actual demonstration.
