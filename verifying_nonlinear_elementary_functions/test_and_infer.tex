\section{The Test-and-Infer Loop}

Testing is an incomplete method of checking specifications of a
function. It samples points from the domain of a function and checks
whether properties hold at those points or not. Sampling larger number
of points may give higher confidence on the correctness of a function.
However, it is practically infeasible to sample all the points in the
domain even if the domain is bounded and this remains testing
incomplete. For example, there are more than $10^{18}$ double-precision
floating-point numbers between $0.0$ and $1.0$. In a modern computer,
it takes more than a second to test an implementation of sine function
on $10^9$ points. It means that it takes more than 30 years to give a
complete coverage on the implementation for the interval $[0.0, 1.0]$.

Test-and-infer is an approach to enhance this weakness of testing.
Whenever it samples a point $c$ from the domain and test a property,
it infers a neighbor $I = [c - \delta, c + \delta]$ of the point $c$
which shares the same test result at point $c$. Using the technique,
we can efficiently cover a region of a domain by testing a point and
it accelerates the overall verification process. In our experiment
shows that it takes about XXX minutes to check a property of sine
implementation on the same interval $[0, 1]$.

\subsection{The Main Algorithm}
We want to partition a given subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of the
domain of a nonlinear elementary function $f : \mathbb{R} \to
\mathbb{R}$ into two sets of intervals:
\begin{align*}
  P & = \{ [l, u] \mid \forall x \in [l, u]. \; | F_f(x) - f(x) | \le \varepsilon \}\\
  F & = \{ [l, u] \mid \forall x \in [l, u]. \; | F_f(x) - f(x) | > \varepsilon \}
\end{align*}
where $F_f$ denotes the function encoding the program. The set $P$
represents a set of points which satisfy the specification while the
set $F$ represents all points which possibly violate the
specification.

  \label{fig:test-and-infer}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Procedure{Test-and-Infer}{f, g, lb, ub, $\varepsilon$}
        \State $c \gets lb$
        \State $P \gets \{\}$
        \State $F \gets \{\}$
        \While{$c \le ub$}
            \If {$ |f(c) - g(c)| \le \varepsilon$}
                % Good
                \State $\delta \gets \mathrm{FindDelta}(f, g(c), c, \varepsilon)$
                \State $P \gets P \cup
                                \{ [c - \delta, c + \delta] \}$
            \Else
                % Bad
                \State $\delta \gets \mathrm{FindDelta}(f, g(c), c, \varepsilon)$
                \State $F \gets F \cup
                                \{ [c - \delta, c + \delta] \}$
            \EndIf
            \State $c \gets c + \delta$
        \EndWhile
    \EndProcedure
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Figure~\ref{fig:test-and-infer} illustrates the main algorithm of our
approach. Given a function $f$, range $[lb, ub]$, and an error-bound
$\varepsilon$, \texttt{Test-and-Infer} returns the two sets $P$ and
$F$. After initialization (line 2 - 4), it executes $f(c)$ and store
the result at $r$ (line 6).


\subsection{Verifying Good Intervals}
For each good input $a\in \mathbb{R}$ and error bound $\varepsilon$,
we find a neighborhood $I$ around $a$ such that
$$\forall x\in I.\; |F_{\sin}(x)-\sin(x)|\leq \varepsilon$$
where $F_{\sin}$ denotes the function encoding the program.

By triangle inequality, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
|F_{\sin}(x) - \sin(x)| \leq |F_{\sin}(x) - \sin(a)| + |\sin(x) - \sin(a)|,
\end{eqnarray}
and we only need to show

\begin{eqnarray}
\forall x\in I.\; |F_{\sin}(x) - \sin(a)| + |\sin(x) - \sin(a)| \leq \varepsilon.
\end{eqnarray}

For this, we can check satisfiability of the negation of the formula, i.e.:
\begin{eqnarray}
\exists x\in I.\; |F_{\sin}(x) - \sin(a)| + |\sin(x) - \sin(a)| > \varepsilon.
\end{eqnarray}

With Taylor expansion, we know
\begin{eqnarray}
|\sin(x) - \sin(a)| > \cos(a) |x - a| - \frac{\sin(a)}{2}(x-a)^2 + ... %check it
\end{eqnarray}

Thus, we only need to show
\begin{eqnarray}
\exists x\in I.\; |F_{\sin}(x) - \sin(a)| + \cos(a) |x - a| -
\frac{\sin(a)}{2}(x-a)^2 > \varepsilon.
\end{eqnarray}

The program encoding can be sliced based on monitoring on the input.
Basically we only need the slice that's used in producing the output.

\subsection{Debugging Bad Intervals}

For a bad input $b$ and error bound $\varepsilon$, we aim to find a
neighborhood $I$ around $b$ such that the error always exhibits:

$$ \forall x\in I.\; |F_{\sin}(x) - \sin(x)| > \varepsilon$$

The bad cases usually come from some bugs in the program. For that we
can have a formula encoding conditions on intermediate variables.
