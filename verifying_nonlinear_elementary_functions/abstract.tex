% We report serious bugs in floating-point computations for evaluating
% elementary functions in the Embedded GNU C Library. For instance, the
% sine function can return values larger than $10^{53}$ in certain
% rounding modes. Further investigation also exposed faulty
% implementations in the most recent version of the library, which
% seemingly fixed some bugs, but only by discarding user-specified
% rounding-mode requirements.
