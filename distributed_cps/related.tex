\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}

PALS~\cite{pals-rtss09,mr-pals-journal,pals-tcs,al2012pattern} targets
distributed real-time systems, whose absence of continuous behaviors
means that continuous behaviors and local clocks do not need to be
taken into account in the synchronous models, which can therefore be
verified by any explicit-state model checker. In contrast, Hybrid PALS
synchronous models must take both clock skews and continuous behaviors
into account and hence cannot be analyzed by explicit-state
techniques. The first steps to add continuous behaviors to PALS were
taken in~\cite{hybrid-pals}. Our work presents a more general
model, where the relative sampling and actuating times are system
parameters,  and also provides a crucial bisimulation result between
the 
synchronous and the distributed model. 

However,  the main difference is in the verification part. 
Previous PALS work \cite{ftscs-journal} used explicit-state model checking, 
based on numerical simulation for the continuous dynamics.
Obviously, this cannot guarantee the correctness of hybrid systems.
Furthermore,
there was no hope of verifying a system for  all possible local clocks.
The paper \cite{hybrid-pals} shows that two interconnected thermostats
can be verified using \textsf{dReal}, but does not present any general SMT techniques for 
Hybrid PALS.
%Also, the previous work considers only particular sampling and actuating times.
 %
Our work presents SMT encodings for bounded reachability, inductive, and
compositional analysis, % of hybrid PALS models,
besides a new SMT framework and more case studies.

Because of the difficulty of handling SMT
formulas over the reals with nonlinear functions, 
SMT-solving-based verification is a fairly new direction for nonlinear hybrid
systems. The research
direction is initiated in~\cite{ratschan2007safety}, which uses constraint
solving algorithms for handling nonlinear reachability problems. Two
main lines of work that explicitly formulate problems as SMT formulas
are based on the HySAT/iSAT
solver~\cite{DBLP:journals/fmsd/FranzleH07,eggers2008sat}
and the MathSAT
solver~\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/CimattiMT12,DBLP:conf/fmcad/CimattiMT12}.
But neither efficient encodings of distributed hybrid systems nor 
inductive and compositional analysis has  been
investigated in existing work along these lines. 
%
It is also worth noting that 
our methods are orthogonal to reachable set computation tools like SpaceEX~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/FrehseGDCRLRGDM11}
and Flow*~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/ChenAS13},
since they can also be used as ODE solvers for $\delta$-compete SMT (e.g., in \textsf{dReal}).

%On the other hand,
%for reachable set computation, 
%%the work on 
%SpaceEX~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/FrehseGDCRLRGDM11}
%has involved methods for handling networks restricted to linear/multiaffine hybrid systems,
%and 
%Flow*~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/ChenAS13} proposed an approach for verifying
%nonlinear hybrid systems using Taylor model flowpipe construction. 
%%
%dReach~\cite{dReach}
%encodes reachability problems of hybrid systems to SMT problems and
%solves them using %a $\delta$-decision procedures, 
%dReal~\cite{dReal}.
%%
%Our approach is different from dReach, 
%since dReach \emph{explicitly} enumerates all mode paths of a hybrid automaton
%to generate many small SMT formulas for these paths.
