\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:concl}

%%% OK, Kyungmin, I am trying here myself ...

We have presented and proved the correctness of the Hybrid PALS
methodology that  greatly simplifies the design and verification of
virtually synchronous cyber-physical systems whose components have
environments with continuous behaviors.  Although Hybrid PALS does not
allow us to abstract from (imprecise) local clocks and the times
transitions are performed, it allows us to abstract from asynchronous
communication (and the resulting interleavings), message buffering,
network delays, 
backoff timers, and so on.







% We have presented Hybrid PALS to reduce the system complexity of distributed cyber-physical systems,
% shows a bisimulation equivalence relating a distributed hybrid PALS model and its underlying synchronous model. 
We have shown that verification problems for Hybrid PALS models can be
expressed as SMT formulas and have developed % a number of techniques 
% We have presented an extended logical theory for distributed hybrid systems and provided an
efficient  SMT-solving-based verification methods for Hybrid PALS. 
We have implemented these techniques in the \textsf{dReal} SMT solver and   have
applied our methodology on a number of non-trivial CPSs. Our
experiments have shown that our techniques dramatically increase the
performance of SMT analysis for distributed hybrid systems with
multiple control modes and nonlinear ODEs up to precision $\delta$.
