\begin{abstract}
The PALS methodology reduces the problem of designing and verifying a
\emph{virtually synchronous} distributed real-time system to the much simpler
task of designing and verifying its underlying \emph{synchronous}
design.  % Cyber-physical systems are typically distributed
% \emph{hybrid} systems in which distributed controllers communicate
% with each other and interact with physical entities with continuous
% dynamics.
This paper presents \emph{Hybrid PALS}, which extends PALS to the important class of
 virtually synchronous cyber-physical systems (CPSs) where  distributed
controllers communicate
with each other and interact with physical entities having \emph{continuous
dynamics}. We  prove a bisimulation equivalence
between the synchronous and the distributed  models. 
We then explain how a number of  verification  problems for synchronous
Hybrid PALS models,  
such as bounded reachability and inductive analysis,
can be reduced to SMT solving over the real numbers with nonlinear
ordinary differential equations up to  arbitrary precision. 
Since such SMT-based analysis typically becomes unfeasible due to the \emph{formula explosion problem},
we  propose
 a new SMT framework to effectively encode distributed hybrid systems in a modular way.
We illustrate the effectiveness of the Hybrid PALS design and
verification methodology on a number of CPSs, including a system for turning an airplane.
