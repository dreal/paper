\section{Introduction}

Computational modeling and analysis methods are playing a crucial role in understanding the complex dynamics of biological systems \citep{liu12jbcb}. In this paper we address the parameter synthesis problem for hybrid models of biological systems.
This problem amounts to finding sets of parameter values for which a model satisfies some precise 
behavioral constraints, such as time series or reachability properties. We focus on hybrid 
continuous/discrete models, since one of the key aspects of many biological systems is their differing 
behavior in various `discrete' modes. For example, it is well-known that the five stages of the cell 
cycle are driven by the activation of different signaling pathways. Hence, hybrid system models are often 
used in systems biology (see, \eg, 
\citep{chen04,tomlin04,Hu04,ye08,aihara10,antoniotti03,lincoln04,baldazzi11}).

Hybrid systems combine discrete control computation with continuous-time evolution. The state space 
of a hybrid system is defined by a finite set of continuous variables and modes. In each mode, the
continuous evolution ({\em flow}) of the system is usually given by the solution of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). At any given time a hybrid system dwells in one of its modes and each variable 
evolves accordingly to the flow in the mode. Jump conditions control the switch to another mode,
possibly followed by a `reset' of the continuous variables. Thus, the temporal dynamics of a 
hybrid system is piecewise continuous.

Hybrid models of biological systems often involve many parameters such as rate constants of 
biochemical reactions, initial conditions, and threshold values in jump conditions. Generally, only 
a few rate constants will be available or can be measured experimentally --- in the latter case
the rate constants are obtained by fitting the model to experimental observations. Furthermore, 
it is also crucial to figure out what initial conditions or jump conditions may lead to an unsafe
state of the system, especially when studying hybrid systems used to inform clinical 
therapy \citep{tanaka10}. All such questions fall within the \textit{parameter synthesis} problem,
which is extremely difficult for hybrid systems. Even simple reachability questions for hybrid 
systems with linear (differential) dynamics are undecidable \citep{henzinger96}.
Therefore, the parameter synthesis problem needs to be relaxed in a sound manner in order to solve
it algorithmically --- this is the approach we shall follow.


In this paper, we tackle the parameter synthesis problem using $\delta$-complete procedures \cite{gao12a} 
for deciding first-order formula with arbitrary computable real functions, including solutions 
of Lipschitz-continuous ODEs \citep{gao12b}. Such procedures may return answers with
one-sided $\delta$-bounded errors, thereby overcoming undecidability issues (note that the maximum 
allowable error $\delta$ is an arbitrarily small positive rational). In our approach we describe 
the set of states of interest as a first-order logic formula and perform bounded model checking \cite{BMC}
to determine reachability of these states. We then adapt an interval constrains propagation based algorithm 
to explore the parameter space and identify the sets of resulting parameters. 
%
We show the applicability of our method by carrying out a thorough case study characterized by 
highly nonlinear hybrid models. We discriminate two cardiac cell action potential 
models \cite{fenton98,orovio08} in terms of cell-type specificity and identify parameter ranges for which a cardiac cell may lose excitability.
The results show that our method can obtain biological insights that are consistent with experimental observations, scales to complex systems. 
%In particular, the cardiac model studied is out of the scope of state-of-the-art tools. 
In particular, the analysis we carried out in the cardiac case study is difficult to be performed by --- if not out of the scope of ---  state-of-the-art tools \cite{prism,breach,taliro,biocham}.
% Bing:  I think the cardiac model is of "out of the scope" of Prism, Biocham, but probably not tools like Breach, Taliro, because one can use simulation-based tools and parameter scan to answer the same questions we asked (e.g. model falsiﬁcation, robustness, parameter identification). Thus, to be safe, I rephrased the strong statement. Please check.

% [Reviewer#1]: "You state that the cardiac model studied is out of the scope of state of the art tools. This is a rather strong statement. Please note that a lot of work exist in traditional modeling and simulation (even outside the area of systems biology), as parameter estimation is one of the essential tasks in all simulation studies. So please be more concrete which state of the art tools you have in mind, and where it has been shown that those do not suffice for the problem at hand."

\paragraph{Related Work.}
A survey of modeling and analysis of biological systems using hybrid models can be found in \cite{luca08}.
Analyzing the properties of biochemical networks using formal verification techniques is being actively
pursued by a number of researchers, for which we refer to Brim's {\em et al.} recent 
survey \cite{BrimSFM13}.
Of particular interest in our context are parameter synthesis methods for qualitative behavior 
specifications (\eg, temporal logic formulas). The method introduced in \cite{rovergene} can deal 
with parameter synthesis for piecewise affine linear systems. For ODEs, 
Donz\'{e} {\em et al.}~\cite{donze} explore the parameter space using adaptive sampling and simulation, 
while Palaniappan {\em et al.} \cite{liu13} use a statistical 
model checking approach. Other techniques perform a sweep of the entire (bounded) parameter space, 
after it has been discretized \cite{Calzone06,Donaldson08}. Randomized optimization techniques were used
for parameter estimation in stochastic hybrid systems \cite{Koutroumpas08}, while identification
techniques for affine systems were used in \cite{Cinquemani08}.

The techniques above can handle nonlinear hybrid systems only through sampling and 
simulation, and so are incomplete. Our approach is instead $\delta$-complete. %so that if a model is found to be unfeasible, then this is correct. 
It is based on verified numerical integration and constraint programming algorithms, which effectively enable an over-approximation of the system dynamics to be computed. Thus, if a model is found to be unfeasible (i.e. an $\mathsf{unsat}$ answer is returned, see Section 2 for more details), then this is correct.  
%A $\delta$-$\mathsf{sat}$ answer might be due to the over-approximation.
This behavior better fits with the safety requirements expected by formal verification.
% Bing: please check above

% [Reviewer#1] "You state that all the other approaches can only handle hybrid systems by sampling and simulation. However, if I understand the appendix correctly, your approach also uses numerical simulation to compute a function, see Page 13. Referring to the delta function I am wondering whether this is related to the problem of the step sizes of numerical integration algorithms and thus the problem e.g., encountered in threshold crossing in hybrid simulation and traditionally addressed by bi-section methods (up to a certain error epsilon), see also your algorithm 1. It seems the language puts together two things that are often kept separately in modeling and simulation, i.e., a model of the dynamics and some requirements referring to the model behavior (its goal), maybe you can comment on this."

% [Paolo]: We may say something along the lines of ‘… dreal is based on verified numerical integration and constraint programming algorithms, which effectively enable us to compute an over-approximation of the system dynamics […] an unsat answer can always be trusted, while a delta-sat answer might be due to the over-approximation […] we chose this behaviour as it better fits with the safety requirements expected by formal verification …’
